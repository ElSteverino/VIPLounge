# VIPLounge

VIP Lounge is a quick little App that aids the user in implementing new Clean-Swift / VIP use cases.  There are no bell or whistles and there is a lot more that could be done.  
Quite frankly, it is my first macOS App since OS X 10.2, so take it for what it’s worth.

Right now it suits my needs and unless something breaks, I don’t plan to support it.  Therefore, I am hereby placing it in the Public Domain to be studied and used.

For more information on Clean-Swift, head over to the Clean-Swift.org website.  Read the BLOG, study the sample code, buy the book; you’ll be glad you did.
